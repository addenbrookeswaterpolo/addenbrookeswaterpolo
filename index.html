        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h2>What is Water Polo?</h2>
        <p>Water polo, is a fast paced water sport. The object is fairly simple -- the team with the most goals wins. Teams play four eight-minute quarters in a pool of varying dimensions. In top quality games the pool is at least six feet deep everywhere, although in the UK this facility is rare, so a shallow pool is used for lower level games.</p>

     
        <h3>Why is it Great Exercise?</h3>
        <p>Players must continually swim or tread water, make quick bursts for the ball, catch and pass the ball in one hand, and use their lower body to propel themselves above the water to shoot. Water polo combines elements of basketball (teamwork), football (contact), and hockey (shooting). In water polo, there is no such thing as standing still. Even at rest, the players must tread water to stay afloat. Exercise physiologists call it the "most physically demanding of all sports."</p>

        <h3>Can women play?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Water polo is a mixed sport and that we have also played in Ladies games and tournaments.</p>

        <h3>How did it start?</h3>
        <p>The modern game originated as a form of rugby football played in rivers and lakes in England and Scotland with a ball constructed of Indian rubber. This "water rugby" came to be called "water polo" based on the English pronunciation of the Balti word for ball, pulu. Water polo is the oldest team sport in the Olympic Games, with the first Olympic water polo game taking place in 1900 in Paris. The Varsity match is an annual game between the ancient Oxford and Cambridge universities, and is the longest running waterpolo fixture in the world, having run since 1891.</p>

        <h3>What are the rules?</h3>
        <p>You can have a look at the complete rules
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_water_polo">here</a>.</p>
